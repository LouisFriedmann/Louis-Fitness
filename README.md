# Louis-Fitness (The website is mostly done to my knowledge, there are a few more things to add, but the website should still run smoothly.)
Local webserver to keep track of your workouts.

In short, this website allows you to set fitness goals for yourself, make workouts, and track your overall progress. Also, you're able to create as many accounts as you'd like. Note: since
this is a local web server, only your computer will have access to this website unless you send the exact website files (that you downloaded from this repository) to another computer. In this case, they'll be able to access your website information, but you both won't be able to access this website together on two separate computers in real time since this is a local web server.

To run this: Have Python 3 or greater installed, place all of the files in this repository in the same directory on your own computer by downloading a zip file of all files and folders in this repository and extracting them to the same directory (this may take 5-10 minutes), install the packages in the file "requirements.txt". Then, run "mainf.py" with an IDE or through the command prompt and click the link that pops up which should direct you to the webserver. If this doesn't work then try installing Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy, and Django, then run "main.py" again.
